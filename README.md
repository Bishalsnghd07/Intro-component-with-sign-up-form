# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign-up form](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/intro-with-sign-up-form-using-tailwindcss-typescript-and-nextjs-2BTazuMoss)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this intro component with sign up form web page.


Users should be able to:
- View the **optimal layout** for the section depending on their device's screen size
- See **focus-visible** states for all interactive elements on the page❤️
- Used **Error handling** and **event listener** by using **DOM** manipulation. When submitting the form, if you fill wrong `inputs` or leave form as empty, then error will catch and the message for this error will say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"* and unable to submit the form.
- If you fill everything correct then your *form will be submit* and you will see Thanks message by displaying that **Thanks for signing up** and also **integrated dismiss button** below by clicking on that you can dismiss the thanks message.
- Added **transition** effect and **hover**🔥 on submit button with new look, make sure to view it.

In addition, I added some *password format validation, focus-visible outline, transition effect, delay animation* as well in submit button.

## 🛠️Built With

- **MObile First Workflow**📲
- **JS Library**🎴

## What I learned

Client side form validation was tough, I was away from javascript. So, first I learnt Javascript basics, then I understand how DOM manipulation works, how event listener works.

I do it all myself using vanilla JS and React.useState(hooks) to manage all of the input validation.

I can be use react form which is JavaScript library to maintain code flow but, I enjoy to dirty my hand on pure JavaScript and I quite enjoy it.

Also, play with `useState` hooks too much to manage state and render to successfull thanks form page. When form is not submitted we show the *Error validation* and form should not be submitted by calling "formSubmitted(false)" and when form is submitted we manage the data in `useState` hook and display the **thanks page** by using "formSubmitted(true)"

*Overall, I'm happy with my progress and want to dip dive more in javascript.*

## Continued Development
- Organised code to enhance **reusability** and **readibility** in many concerns, what I did it, I make different organised component for the **form** and passed as a *prop* in the main component, to maintain *code quality* and *code cleaniliness*.
- I would love to work on **tailwind CSS** and would *explore* more **JS Library** and will continue *implement* in my further projects.
- Added **delay animation** and would love to add more new animation features.
- For **client side Validation** I used pure javascript, can be use *react form* easily, but wants to enhance my skills in **DOM manipulation** with live projects, will use react form in **larger project** to enhance *code flow*.
